Gove apologises after Covid report alleges toxic culture21 November 2025ShareSaveKate WhannelPolitical reporterShareSaveGetty ImagesFormer cabinet minister Lord Michael Gove has apologised on behalf of the then-government and Conservative Party for mistakes made during the coronavirus pandemic.In her long-awaited report published, Baroness Hallett says Boris Johnson, the prime minister at the time, oversaw a toxic and chaotic culture in No 10 during Covid.Lord Gove told the BBCs Today programme some attitudes in Downing Street had been far from ideal but added that in a crisis the business of government cant be carried out in the manner of a Jane Austen novel. He also said an earlier lockdown would have been wiser but questioned the reports assertion that it would have meant fewer deaths.Responding to the report, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the government would learn lessons from the report and was already taking measures to make sure that, not just the NHS but the government as a whole, is prepared for any number of eventualities.The 800-page inquiry report is highly critical of government decision-making, and says implementing a Covid lockdown a week earlier could have saved 23,000 lives in the first wave in England - although it does not suggest that the overall death toll would have been reduced.It also says lockdowns could have been avoided if the government had introduced restrictions such as social distancing earlier and concludes lockdowns only became inevitable because of the acts and omissions of the four governments in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

He said Johnsons style of decision-making may not be to everyones taste but added he was wrestling with an enormously difficult question about the curtailment of liberty and the maintenance of access to healthcare.More than that, without his drive we would not have had his vaccine roll-out that ensured we were the first country to put jabs in arms.Dominic Cummings, a senior aide in Downing Street at the time, is singled out for criticism in the report which suggests he displayed destabilising behaviour and contributed to a culture of fear that poisoned the atmosphere.
