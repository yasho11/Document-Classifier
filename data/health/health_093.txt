But there are requirementsThey must be resident of England and Wales and be registered with a GP for at least 12 monthsThey must have the mental capacity to make the choice and be deemed to have expressed a clear, settled and informed wish, free from coercion or pressureThey must be expected to die within six monthsThey must make two separate declarations, witnessed and signed by them or a proxy on their behalf, about their wish to dieTwo independent doctors must be satisfied the person is eligible - and there must be at least seven days between the doctors assessmentsA High Court judge must hear from at least one of the doctors and can also question the dying person, or anyone else they consider appropriate.
