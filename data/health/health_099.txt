The junior doctors strikes may be over. But is trouble ahead?2 August 2024ShareSaveNick TriggleHealth correspondentShareSaveBBCIt had been the NHSs longest-running and bitterest pay dispute - responsible for hundreds of thousands of cancelled operations and appointments.And then, suddenly, word came on Monday that the British Medical Association was recommending that its 50,000 junior doctor members accept a fresh offer from the new government.It sounded almost too good to be true. And now some are wondering if it might be.Whats the deal?Last Friday, just three days after formal negotiations started at the Department of Healths London headquarters, Health Secretary Wes Streeting laid his cards on the table.It was, he made clear to the British Medical Association delegation, a final offer - a pay rise topping 22 on average over two years in England.The unions team said they wanted to think about it over the weekend. On Sunday, the BMA junior doctor leaders met and decided that, while it fell short of their demand for a 35 pay increase, this was the best deal they could get.Cue much trumpeting from the government - in her appearance at the House of Commons, Chancellor Rachel Reeves paid tribute to work put in by the health secretary.How it was brokeredMr Streeting had met the BMA joint junior doctor leaders Dr Rob Laurenson and Dr Vivek Trivedi several times before the election - asking them in their last meeting on Zoom to call off the strike they were about to hold in the lead-up to polling day.When he was made health secretary, Mr Streeting immediately called the BMA to set up talks. Two meetings were held with Dr Laurenson and Dr Trivedi in a 10-day period following his appointment - before the formal pay talks started.The health secretarys hand was helped by the fact the independent pay review bodys recommendations for the 2024-25 pay rise had just landed on his desk, suggesting a 6 pay rise and 1,000 lump sum be given.This allowed him to make an offer which effectively combined two years of pay rises. He topped up last years pay award - worth nearly 9 on average - with an extra 4 as well as agreeing to the pay review bodys recommendation for the current financial year.In less than a week of talks, the new health secretary had achieved what the previous government had failed to do over the course of 11 strikes in the previous 18 months.So everyone claims theyve won?Whats important is it could be presented as a win-win for both sides, one source close to the talks said.The BMA got a big number, while the government only put in an extra 4 above what the pay review body recommended across the two years - that is just one percentage point more than what the Tories put on the table back in December when talks collapsed.Defending the deal, Ms Reeves called the costs - around 350m - a drop in the ocean compared to the 1.7bn cost of NHS strikes.That may all be true, but whats on offer to junior doctors has not gone unnoticed
