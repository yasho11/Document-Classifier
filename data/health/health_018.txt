Has flu peaked? What the figures tell us18 December 2025ShareSaveJim Reed,Health reporter,Wesley Stephenson,BBC VerifyandNick Triggle,Health correspondentShareSaveGetty ImagesThe NHS remains on high alert over flu, health bosses say, but there are clear signs the surge in the virus has come to an end for now at least.Community spread appears to have stabilised, the UK Health Security Agency says.Meanwhile, the rise in hospital cases has slowed. And with just over 3,000 patients in hospital in England with the virus, the dire prediction by NHS chief executive Sir Jim Mackay of between 5,000 and 8,000 cases has not materialised.How serious then is this flu season so far, and how does it really compare to previous outbreaks of the virus? The major difference between the 2025 flu season and the last three years is that the virus started spreading a few weeks earlier than normal.When someone goes to their GP or hospital with flu-like symptoms, they can be swabbed and tested for influenza, Covid, RSV and other viruses.UKHSA then records the percentage of those tests that come back positive for flu.Figures had been rising quickly over the autumn and at the start of winter.But last week the spread of the virus appears to have stabilised at a medium level, UKHSA says.It is too early to say whether this marks the start of the peak. Flu is unpredictable, a lull can be followed by another surge.The picture across the four nations of the UK is similar.Some virologists have linked the earlier flu season this year to the type of virus that is circulating - known as H3N2.Historically, seasons dominated by that strain tend to be more severe, with larger numbers of hospitalisations in older people, in particular.H3N2 has not been the main form of flu detected in the UK for three years, which may mean that less immunity has been built up in the population.Scientists also spotted a further shift in the genetic makeup of the virus over the summer.This might have given the virus a head-start in the autumn.Can we call it super-flu?The name super-flu has been used by the NHS to describe this latest outbreak.But that is not a medical term, and it does not mean the virus itself has suddenly become more dangerous or harder to treat.It is misleading and a bit frightening to call it super flu its just a flu variant that is clearly a little bit more infectious than normal, says Prof Lawrence Young, professor of molecular oncology at the University of Warwick.What were seeing is a flu season thats perhaps two to three weeks earlier than normal.Separately, the NHS also records the number of the sickest patients in hospital with flu over the winter. Trends in hospital data tends to lag behind community spread as it takes some time for people to get ill enough to seek hospital care.Figures for last week showed the number hit 3,140 in England, an 18 rise on the week before. But that was after a 55 jump in the week before that.Although the national figure masks what i
