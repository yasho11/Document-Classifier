Operations and treatments cut back as NHS orders hospitals to save money12 December 2025ShareSaveNick TriggleHealth correspondentShareSaveGetty ImagesNHS bosses have been dealing with the competing priorities of taming costs while trying to reduce backlogsAccess to hospital treatments is being restricted in many areas of England as the NHS struggles to balance its books, the BBC has learnt.Regional health boards have ordered some hospitals to cut back on the number of patients they are seeing, meaning hundreds of thousands of patients could have to wait longer for treatment.The rationing measures are being applied mainly to private firms doing NHS work, but multiple NHS hospitals are understood to be affected too.NHS managers said they were between a rock and a hard place trying to juggle balancing the books with tackling the hospital backlog, which currently stands at 7.4 million.Reducing waits for things like hip and knee operations and hitting the 18-week waiting time target is the governments number one priority for the health service.But documents seen by the BBC show integrated care boards, which are in charge of spending on behalf of NHS England, asking hospitals to make patients wait longer and reduce the numbers they treat until the end of the financial year.One asked a private provider to reduce activity by nearly 30 and to make patients wait eight weeks longer, on average, while stopping taking on new referrals for a period as a way to cut back on the amount being done.Surgery cancelledA surgeon at a private hospital said they had had to cancel all their scheduled NHS operations for the coming weeks, with some patients only given a few days notice.They told the BBC I had a full day of joint surgery planned this week and patients were just told a few weeks before that their life-changing operations would not be taking place.Many of them had been waiting over 40 weeks for treatment. Its devastating for them.A letter by Circle, one of the biggest private hospital providers in the country, to its doctors said at some sites they may have to stop seeing NHS patients altogether.Daniel Elkeles, of NHS Providers, which represents NHS hospitals, said restrictions were also being placed on some NHS hospitals, calling it a real concern.If the government really wants them to deliver the 18-week target they would have to go flat out and use all available capacity and that will mean needing additional funding.Regional health boards are using what are known as activity management plans to push individual hospitals into reducing the number of patients they see.They are predominantly being used when hospitals are treating more patients than expected.They can also be used to push hospitals into treating more when activity levels are below expected.The BBC has seen evidence or had confirmation from a host of health boards that restrictions have been put in places in parts of the north west, north east, south west, Yorkshire, the East Midland
