It will also now cover milk substitutes - plant-based drinks like soya, oat and rice milks with added sugar.Milk-based drinks have been exempt from the sugar tax because they contain calcium, which is encouraged in children and young peoples diets.However, the high sugar content of some milk-based drinks means the government has removed that exemption.The government will introduce a lactose allowance to account for the natural sugars in the milk content of these drinks.All milk substitute drinks, such as soya, almond or oat drinks, were previously exempt from the sugar tax if they contained 120mg of calcium per 100ml.But if these drinks contain added sugars beyond those derived from the main ingredient, they will now be taxed.Getty ImagesEverything you need to know about the BudgetWhat drinks are not included?The sugar tax does not apply to drinks made and served in cafés, restaurants and bars.
