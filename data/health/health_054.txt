Delayed action before 2020 Christmas lockdown inexcusable21 November 2025ShareSaveMark PalmerWales assistant editorShareSaveGetty ImagesWales was the last part of the UK to mandate the wearing of face coveringsThe circumstances which led to the Welsh governments decision to impose a Christmas 2020 Covid lockdown across Wales were inexcusable, says the chair of the UK public inquiry into the pandemic.Baroness Hallet said Welsh ministers had failed to take decisive action against an entirely foreseeable Covid variant resulting in the lockdown.Prior to the lockdown, she said ministers had relaxed measures more quickly than scientists advised.
