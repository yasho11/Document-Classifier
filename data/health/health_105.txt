Group supports those with lonely condition4 December 2025ShareSaveEllen Knightin Weston RhynShareSaveBBCELLEN KNIGHTBethany Lewis was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome in April 2025A young woman has founded a support group for women with reproductive health problems, like polycystic ovary syndrome PCOS.Bethany Lewis, 18, is a trainee dental nurse from Weston Rhyn in Shropshire and was diagnosed with PCOS in April 2025.A few months later she set up The Cysters Circle, which meets up periodically across the county in different towns to reach a wider audience.PCOS causes painful and irregular periods, and the NHS estimates it affects up to one in 10 women in the UK. The circle was really needed, not just for myself but for other people as well, Ms Lewis said. PCOS is a hormonal disorder that leads to ovaries producing large amounts of male sex hormones that interfere with the development and release of a womans eggs and can also affect periods and fertility.Ms Lewis said her symptoms include very heavy periods and dull pain that doesnt go away, meaning she often has to take very strong painkillers.Getty ImagesMs Lewis said she has to take very strong medication to help with the pain of heavy periodsThe circle supports women and girls with endometriosis, PCOS, or any other hormonal and reproductive health conditions, she said.When she was first diagnosed in April, Ms Lewis said she didnt know anything about the condition, educating herself using the internet.Its been challenging mentally as well as physically, she added.Its very lonely as well, so its good to have the support in the group.Awareness needed across UKThe groups first meeting last month had just two other attendees - but a few weeks later, at their next meet-up in Telford, eleven women took part.Its a massive jump in comparison to our first one, and its nice to just start building that community, Ms Lewis said.Those attending share experiences, recommendations, and vent frustrations.We have quite a lot of resources from charities as well that were able to hand out, Ms Lewis continued. Its nice to sit there with people who actually understand what youre going through.Her goal is to support more women and girls, adding that raising awareness is needed not just locally in Shropshire, but around the UK.Follow BBC Shropshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.
