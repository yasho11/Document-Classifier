Kennedy JrAn overhaul of US childhood immunisation guidelines has dropped the number of diseases children should be vaccinated against from 17 to 11.The new list of recommended vaccines, issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday, includes polio and measles vaccines, but others, like hepatitis A and B, and Covid vaccines, are recommended based on risk and shared clinical decision-making between doctors and parents, the announcement said. President Donald Trump praised the new recommendation saying it was rooted in the gold standard of science.However, the American Academy of Pediatrics criticised the recommendation, describing it as dangerous and unnecessary.The overhaul is the latest sweeping policy change made under the Trump administration spearheaded by health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr.Many Americans, especially the MAHA Moms, have been praying for these COMMON SENSE reforms for many years, Trump said in a statement online referring to the Make America Healthy Again slogan.Kennedy, who has long been sceptical of vaccines, said the overhaul came after an exhaustive review and that it protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health.We are aligning the U.S. childhood vaccine schedule with international consensus while strengthening transparency and informed consent, he added.According to the CDC, the recommended vaccines for all children will include vaccines to protect against measles, mumps, rubella, polio, pertussis, tetanus, diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae type B Hib, pneumococcal disease, human papillomavirus HPV, and varicella chicken pox.A second category of vaccines was recommended for children depending on risk factors.
