Resident doctors in Scotland to go on strike for first time19 December 2025ShareSaveLisa Summers,Scotland health and social care correspondentandCatherine Lyst,BBC ScotlandShareSaveGetty ImagesScotlands resident doctors are to go on strike in a dispute over pay - the first time a national walkout has been staged by NHS workers.Their union BMA Scotland had accused the government of reneging on a commitment to restore pay to 2008 levels.With 92 of those who turned out voting in favour, strike dates have been set for 0700 on Tuesday 13 January to 0700 on Saturday 17 January 2026.Health Secretary Neil Gray said he was disappointed by the result, adding that he had offered to meet the BMA Scotland chairman on Monday.With 5,185 resident doctors in Scotland eligible to vote, turnout was 58 with a total of 3,008 votes cast.BMA Scotland earlier said it still believed a resolution could be found and had called for the Scottish government to get back to the negotiating table and present a credible offer.Resident doctors - who used to be called junior doctors - make up almost half of the medical workforce in Scotland.They range from newly qualified doctors to those with 10 years or more experience.Mr Gray said Resident doctors in Scotland have received a 4.25 pay uplift this year - as part of a two-year deal - the same as accepted by nurses and other NHS staff.This means by 2027, we will have delivered a cumulative pay rise of 35 in four years.Our top priority for our patients and the workforce is to improve waiting times, access to the NHS and positive outcomes. Industrial action will put all that progress at risk.Scotland had been the only part of the UK to have avoided strike action by NHS workers.A strike in the summer of 2023 was called off at the last minute after a deal was agreed.As part of that, BMA Scotland said the government committed to making credible progress towards restoring pay to 2008 levels in each of the three following financial years.A series of strikes by resident doctors in England has led to thousands of operations and procedures being cancelled.An ongoing five-day walkout is causing further disruption and has been described as dangerous and utterly irresponsible by Prime Minister Keir Starmer.Any strike in Scotland would be a major blow to the Scottish governments promise to end long waits for procedures and appointments by March 2026 and would put even more pressure on an overstretched NHS in an election year.PA MediaResident doctors have been taking part in a series of strikes in England Dr Chris Smith, chairman of the BMA resident doctors committee, said The result of this ballot shows that resident doctors in Scotland are united in anger over the Scottish government breaking the deal they agreed over pay just two years ago.This is not where we wanted to be. However, we have sent a message loud and clear  the government cannot brazenly renege on its commitments without expecting to be held to account.Ins
