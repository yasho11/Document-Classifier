The myth of willpower - and why some people struggle to lose weight more than others2 days agoShareSaveNick TriggleHealth correspondentShareSaveBBCListen to this pieceFat people just need more self-control. Its about personal responsibility. Its simple, just eat less.These were some of the 1,946 comments, posted by readers, beneath an article I wrote last year about weight-loss injections.The idea that obesity is simply a matter of willpower is held by a great many people - including some medical professionals.Eight out of 10 people said obesity could be entirely prevented by lifestyle choices alone, according to a study of people in the UK, Australia, New Zealand and the US, which was published in medical journal The Lancet.But Bini Suresh, a dietitian, who has spent 20 years working with obese and overweight patients, is exasperated by the idea.This, she believes, is only a fraction of the picture.I frequently see patients who are highly motivated, knowledgeable and trying consistently yet still struggling with weight.Terms like willpower and self-control are the wrong words, agrees Dr Kim Boyd, medical director at WeightWatchers.

A mutation in this gene, which encourages overeating and means we feel less full, is ca
