Getting financial help through my GP has improved my health24 October 2025ShareSaveGem OReillyLondonShareSavegettyGP surgeries in south London are giving financial advice to help patients manage debt and handle benefits claims - and the results are striking. In the 34 practices running the Back on Track scheme in Lambeth and Southwark, one in three patients visited their GP less often after receiving advice, and more than 1,100 people have secured benefits, cleared debts or seen reduced stress levels.One of the people who have benefited from the project is 62-year-old Ife, from Stockwell.She has chronic pain from arthritis and had fallen into energy debt after being forced to give up her job due to mobility issues, while awaiting knee replacement surgery.Her Capability Benefit claim was turned down, despite her limited ability to stand up for long or get around, and financial worries left her very down.But when Ife found out about the programme through her local GP surgery, a financial support link worker helped her to appeal successfully against the UC decision, and to secure disability benefits. Ife was also helped with her energy and water debts through an affordable payment plan.She said When the doctors surgery told me about Back on Track it was such a relief.

She wasnt sleeping, had lost confidence in physical activity and was struggling to find work.We ran multiple blood and cardiac tests as she sought reassurance. Over time it became clear her symptoms were linked to severe stress, driven by rent worries and debt. Being able to name this as a possible cause and immediately offer support transformed the consultation.Without that offer of specialist help, how could I have centred financial health in her care, or expected her to accept it as the root issue with no solution?Six months later she returned once, reflecting on how stress had affected her health and how she was taking steps to improve it.People with long-term health conditions of
