Yet many women still face barriers to regular exercise. Ella Al-Shamahi speaks to two women in India and Uganda whove created grass roots fitness communities exclusively for women. Mildred Apenyo is the founder of FitcliqueAfrica - a women-only gym which is the first of its kind in Uganda. She says that issues such as battling for space, safety and finding socially acceptable sports outfits makes attending the gym a daunting prospect for many women across East Africa. Her Kampala-based startup is focused on the overall wellness and safety of women rather than the attainment of the ideal body with classes ranging from strength training to African Yoga and even self-defence workshops. Swetha Subbiah co-founded Sisters In Sweat in 2017, in Bangalore with a mission to address the concerning percentage of women in India who, for a myriad of reasons are dropping out of sport after school or college. She points out that the landscape of organised recreational sport for women in India is virtually non-existent and wants to ensure that women have a platform to participate in and enjoy playing a sport with a community of like-minded individuals.
