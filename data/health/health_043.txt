Much of 11bn Covid scheme fraud beyond recovery, report says9 December 2025ShareSaveNick EdserBusiness reporterShareSaveGetty ImagesMuch of the 10.9bn in taxpayer money lost to fraud and error in Covid support schemes is now beyond recovery, a report has said.The response to the pandemic had led to enormous outlays of public money which exposed it to the risk of fraud and error with many organisations unprepared, the Covid Counter Fraud Commissioner, Tom Hayhoe, said.Employment support schemes set up by the previous Conservative government, including furlough and help for the self-employed, suffered 5bn of fraud, the report found.Many of the support measures were credited with propping up the economy throughout the Covid lockdowns. However, Mr Hayhoe said the outrage at fraud, abuse and error was undiminished.Mr Hayhoe had been asked by Chancellor Rachel Reeves to investigate the amount of public money lost to fraud given his experience in procurement as the former chair of an NHS trust.The near 11bn lost to fraud and error is close to what the government spends on the UKs justice system. The report said 1.8bn had been recovered, although Much of the shortfall is now beyond recovery.However, it added that there were still areas where investing in recovering money paid out incorrectly is worthwhile and work should continue.When asked on BBC Radio 5 live how much more money could be recovered, Mr Hayhoe said I dont know. But he added that new laws extended the amount of time authorities had to uncover fraud cases. Mr Hayhoe said that, for him, the main issue to come out of study was the scale at which people were prepared to pull a fast one and make money out of the taxpayer in a crisis.If theres one single lesson that comes out of this is the lesson that you cant assume that everyone  even in difficult times like Covid-19 was  will do the right thing.What is the UK Covid inquiry and how does it work?Government racks up 100m bill responding to Covid inquiryThe report found weak accountability, bad quality data and poor contracting contributed to the losses.Most public bodies were unprepared for a crisis that required spending on such a scale and with such urgency.Consequently, some measures to protect against potential fraud were inadequate.This applied to the procurement of Personal Protective Equipment PPE where the volume of orders overwhelmed the newly created supply chain and involved measures that invited mistrust, opportunism and profiteering.It found 13.6bn was spent on PPE procurement, with 38 billion items purchased - although 11 billion were unused by 2024. Losses were estimated at 10bn from over-ordering and 324m of fraud.The support for small businesses was also criticised, where lending relied on self-certification with inadequate checks to prevent abuse.It said the design of the Bounce Back Loan Scheme created specific vulnerabilities to fraud and error.
