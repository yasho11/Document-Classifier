Having skin cancer while pregnant made me feel so guiltyA woman says she felt so guilty for having skin cancer while pregnant with her son.Emma Giannuzzi, 36, from Rogerstone, Newport, used sunbeds regularly in her late teens and was diagnosed with melanoma twice - first at 23, and again during pregnancy after noticing a mole on her stomach, with tests after giving birth confirming the cancer.She is now urging people to opt for fake tanning products instead, warning of the dangers of sunbed use.According to the NHS, sunbeds are more harmful than natural sunlight because they emit concentrated UV radiation, increasing the risk of skin cancer, premature ageing, sunburn and eye damage.Gilly Perkins, from the Sunbed Association, said professional salons follow strict safety rules, making controlled sunbed use safer than unregulated sunbathing.Video filmed and edited by Tink Llewellyn7 days agoWalesSkin cancerHealthNewportRogerstoneShareSaveCouple hope immersive room will stop AE fear for familiesThe parents of an autistic six-year-old say the new AE room aims to help families at hospital.WalesTowns logness monster gets swept out to seaHigh tides swept Lizzy the logness monster from her seafront perch in Porthcawl, Bridgend county.WalesA dream can become real, says world record holder, 11Max has become the youngest male video game developer after his four-hour attempt in May.WalesBarefoot man in handcuffs escapes police and scales wallDylan Harrison was handcuffed when he escaped from a police van as he was taken out of the vehicle.WalesKevin Sinfield meets family of boy who died of MNDKevin Sinfield meets the family of Kyle Sieniawski, who died from motor neurone disease aged 14.WalesYoung women call for better health educationNew resources are being designed to improve understanding of common conditions.WalesPoliticians thrash out key issues in live TV debateThey clashed over the NHS, the two-child benefit cap and increasing Senedd members.WalesTaser me bro - Man Tasered after taunting policeArron Dean was jailed for 26 weeks after appearing in Llandudno Magistrates Court.WalesCritically endangered rhino born at farmThere are only 1471 eastern black rhinos left in the wild and 109 in zoos across Europe.WalesLorry driver with misted up windscreen causes pile-upThis is the moment a lorry driver with a misted windscreen ploughed into the back of a van.WalesWatch Shopkeeper fights off robbery attempt with milk crateCCTV footage shows the shopkeeper being threatened with a knife by two women.WalesFirefighters tackle blaze at historic rugby clubAn investigation into the cause of the fire at Penarth Rugby Club is under way.WalesMatthew Rhys steals Netflix character from Anthony HopkinsThe actor admits he unashamedly copied his fellow Welshmans portrayal of killer Hannibal Lecter.WalesFrom taxes to AI investment  how the Budget will impact WalesThe first minister welcomed the announcement, but Plaid said the cash boost was tiny co
