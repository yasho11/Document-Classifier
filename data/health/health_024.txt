Chickenpox vaccines for young children start across UK5 days agoShareSavePhilippa Roxby and Smitha MundasadHealth reportersShareSaveGetty ImagesAll young children in the UK can now be offered protection against chickenpox for the first time on the NHS.The vaccine will be combined with the existing MMR jab, given at 12 and 18 months of age, which already helps protect against measles, mumps and rubella. Children up to the age of six can catch up on doses when invited.Experts say the new, combined vaccine called MMRV, where V stands for varicella - another name for chickenpox - is expected to reduce the many thousands of families affected by the infection each year and prevent the most severe cases.Until now, parents have had to pay up to 200 to buy a vaccine privately to protect their children.From 1 January, the MMRV vaccine will be introduced into the standard list of childrens vaccinations in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, with Scotland announcing a rollout start date in early January.What is chickenpox and how can I get my child vaccinated?Chickenpox is very common in young children. The main feature is an itchy, spotty rash which blisters then scabs over. It can be painful, and cover the body from head to toe. Children often feel unwell for several days, with a fever and muscle aches.It also spreads easily. Some 90 of children under the age of 10 catch chickenpox at some point, and a week off school or nursery is fairly common. But it can develop into something more severe, warns Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, deputy director of immunisation at the UK Health Security Agency.For some babies, young children and even adults, chickenpox can be very serious, leading to hospital admission and tragically, while rare, it can be fatal, she said.Complications can include bacterial infection of scabs, and much more rarely, a swelling of the brain known as encephalitis, lung inflammation known as pnemonitis, and stroke.Young babies and adults are more likely to be seriously ill with the infection. Pregnant women are particularly at risk because of potential complications in both the mother and unborn baby.What is chickenpox and how can I get my child vaccinated?My daughter is still living with the pain, 14 years onMaria HortonBeths mum Maria says she would have given her daughter the vaccine if it had been available 14 years agoMaria Hortons daughter, Beth, was just two-and-a-half years old when she had a stroke in the weeks after getting chickenpox.She collapsed and her arm and leg went all floppy and then she started to have a seizure, Ms Horton, who lives in Plymouth, said.Beth has had to live with many of the consequences ever since - she cant use her right hand, has speech difficulties and lives in pain, her mother said.I know some people are hesitant about vaccines but if Id known years ago what I know now, I wouldnt hesitate to give her the vaccine.As a mum, if you could go back in time and stop something catastrophic happening to
