Toxic No 10 culture harmed Covid response, inquiry finds20 November 2025ShareSavePaul Seddon,Political reporterandSam Francis,Political reporterShareSavePA MediaBoris Johnson oversaw a toxic and chaotic culture within government that led to poor Covid decision-making, the inquiry into the pandemic response has found.In a much-awaited report, inquiry chair Baroness Hallett said the former prime minister should have responded more urgently to the developing crisis.She also criticised his style of communication, which failed to convey a proper sense of caution and undermined official health messaging, she said.Johnsons former top adviser Dominic Cummings was also singled out as a destabilising influence and former health secretary Matt Hancock was criticised in the 800-page report.Former judge Baroness Hallett said Cummings, who dramatically left No 10 in late 2020 after internal battles over his role, contributed to a culture of fear that poisoned the atmosphere in Downing Street.Cummings strayed far from the proper role of an adviser, she added, and tried to make key decisions in Johnsons place - a situation the former prime minister appeared happy with, she wrote.He also materially contributed to the toxic and sexist workplace culture including using offensive, sexualised and misogynistic language in messages, the inquiry found.UK did too little, too late, leading to thousands more Covid deaths, says inquiryLockdown could have been avoided - key findings from Covid inquiryThe private notes and secret documents that tell the inside story of the UKs Covid responseCummings was also often a catalyst for action and was among the first political figures to demand strategy meetings and modelling to deal with Covid, the report found.Alongside civil servants, Cummings helped drive the creation of the Covid-19 Taskforce in the Cabinet Office, which the report said improved the coordination of the governments response.
