Prostate cancer screening What you need to know3 December 2025ShareSavePhilippa RoxbyHealth reporterShareSaveGetty ImagesThe UKs National Screening Committee has recommended that only a very small group of men at high risk of prostate cancer should be screened for the disease.There is currently no screening programme for prostate cancer, the most common cancer in men.But there has been some energetic campaigning for change by high-profile figures, including Sir Chris Hoy, who has terminal prostate cancer, and Lord David Cameron, who recently revealed hed been treated for it.The expert advice will now be consulted on for the next three months, before the screening committee gives its final recommendations to governments in the four nations of the UK in March.What is screening?Screening is when people are invited for a test to look for disease despite them having no symptoms.Examples include women being invited for a mammogram to look for breast cancer or the at-home bowel cancer test posted to the home of everyone over the age of 50, every two years.The idea is to catch cancer before someone starts to get ill and when it can still be treated.What are the symptoms of prostate cancer?NHS to offer same-day prostate cancer diagnosisNHS to review prostate cancer testing after Chris Hoy call for changeWhat has the National Screening Committee recommended?The committee said there was no justification for screening the large majority of men for prostate cancer.It looked at all the available evidence and concluded that screening was only suitable formen with a genetic risk of prostate cancer with a confirmed BRCA gene variantThe advice says this group should be screened every two years between the ages of 45 and 61.This means no screening is recommended for other high-risk groups of men such asblack menmen with a family history of prostate cancerWhy did the committee come to that conclusion?The committee said a mass screening programme for prostate cancer was likely to cause more harm than good.Tests for the disease are unreliable, and can lead to men being treated for a slow-growing cancer that isnt going to cause them any harm. The treatment itself can cause incontinence and impotence, which can significantly affect quality of life.Balanced against that, finding cancers early and treating them can save lives. But its difficult for doctors to work out which cancers are going to be aggressive and spread, which means men can be treated unnecessarily.The committee said the number of lives saved by screening does not outweigh its harmful effects on healthy men.Why not screen all high-risk men?Many experts had expected that all men at high risk of the disease were likely to be included in new screening plans.But the committee stopped short of that recommendation.Despite black men having twice the risk of prostate cancer, it said there should be no screening for black men due to uncertainties around its impact, and a lack of evidence from clinical tr
