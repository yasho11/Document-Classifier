Is the system letting down people who were harmed by Covid vaccines?23 October 2024ShareSaveFergus WalshMedical editorShareSaveBBCThere is nothing in life that is free of risk. That includes vaccines. But the evidence is compelling that the benefits of getting immunised with those vaccines recommended in the UK far outweigh the possibility of serious side effects.The level of benefit from Covid vaccines is well documented. And the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine is credited with saving more lives in the first year of its use than any other - 6.3m globally compared to 5.9m for PfizerBioNTechs jab.However, we need to discuss not just the huge positives that Covid vaccines brought, but also the small minority left injured or bereaved by the AstraZeneca vaccine.Around 50 families affected by rare blood clots have begun a group legal action for compensation under the Consumer Protection Act, arguing that the vaccine was not as safe as the public were entitled to expect.This includes people who have been left with severe physical injuries, those who are unable to work, and bereaved families who lost a loved one due to vaccine damage.They are a tiny fraction of all those vaccinated, but that is no comfort to the families affected, who feel like they have been airbrushed out of the pandemic and that their pleas for support have been ignored.Those families include Jane and Ian Wrigley from Buckinghamshire.Jane, 62, used to run, ski and climb mountains. Now she can barely walk due to extreme weakness down her left-hand side.HandoutJane pictured at a Parkrun, before she was affected by blood clots - and with her husband Ian more recentlyTwo weeks after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine in March 2021, Jane was admitted to hospital. She suffered blood clots in her brain and required emergency surgery to remove part of her skull. Janes medical records clearly state that she suffered these blood clots as a direct side effect of the vaccine.Her husband Ian is now her full-time carer. Jane told me Before I had the vaccine I was a very independent, active woman doing half marathons and enjoying my life. Now Ive lost every bit of independence.Her case, and those of others affected by blood clots, raises serious questions about whether the system is letting down those who have suffered serious harm as a result of taking Covid vaccines.Social contractAlmost 25m adults in the UK received a first dose of the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine in 2021, and nearly all those had a second.It is estimated that the Covid vaccine programme prevented over a quarter of a million hospital admissions and over 120,000 deaths in the UK up to September 2021.The side effects of vaccination are usually mild and short-lived such as a sore arm, fever and fatigue.However, in the very rare event that something goes seriously wrong, we have a right to expect that we will be supported. This is a kind of social contract between individual and state.Thats where the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme V
