Having them there also made the experience feel more comfortable and casual, she says.Bianca Ionici, 27, who lives in London, says she put off her cervical screening for at least two years because of concerns about pain.But after getting another invite which contained a lot of information about the process, Bianca booked her screening in January.Bianca IoniciBianca Ionici delayed her cervical screening because of concerns about painOther people say they booked their screenings as soon as they could.Eleanor Gratton, who had her test at the end of last year aged 25, says her friends were scared the process would be uncomfortable and painful.

I couldnt feel anything. She says the fact shed already had two children made her less anxious about the experience.
