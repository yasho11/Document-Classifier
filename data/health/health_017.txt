Whats really going on with flu this winter?20 December 2025ShareSaveJames GallagherHealth and science correspondentShareSaveGetty ImagesFlu should always be taken seriously. It is a virus that kills thousands of people every winter and puts intense strain on hospitals.However, I cant remember a flu season that has played out quite like this. There have been claims it is both a superflu and unprecedented across the media and even from NHS England - while experts say this years flu is not out of the ordinary with accusations of crying wolf.So whats really going on and is anything truly different this year?As I reported in early November, there were concerns the flu season had the potential to be the worst for a decade.Scientists who track the multitude of flu viruses around the world noticed seven fresh mutations appear in a strain of influenza  a type called H3N2  in June.This newly mutated virus rapidly became the dominant form of H3N2 and was named subclade-K.The flu season took off a month early in the UK hinting the virus may have the potential to spread more widely than normal and it was too late to adjust this years flu vaccine to match the new mutations.That was the concern, but the reality has been more in line with a normal flu than a super flu.Getty ImagesH3N2 strain of influenza The K-flu virus has not gained a dramatic ability to rip through the population.It was basically spreading at a very similar speed to previous years, it was towards the upper end, but it wasnt an outlier, says Prof Christophe Fraser, who is analysing the spread of the virus at the Pandemic Sciences Institute at the University of Oxford.His teams latest analyses, still to be published, suggest the mutations did give the virus a slight edge at slipping past our immunity  in the region of 5-10 more than usual. It is not clear if that applies to everyone or is concentrated just in children and young adults who have caught less flu in the past and who have been most affected so far. Has flu peaked? What the figures tell usFlu How are hospitals in your area affected?H3N2 viruses always tend to be more severe for the elderly and there is no clear evidence the virus is worse than expected this year. A rapid analysis of the seasonal flu vaccine also suggested it was performing in line with previous years despite fears of a mismatch.Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, a consultant epidemiologist at the UKHSA, said The things that we saw that were unusual this season are the early start to the season, we also saw this change to the virus, with more evolution than we typically see.But overall, in terms of the impact on the NHS and the impact on peoples health, were seeing a broadly typical flu season.There are suggestions that flu may already be peaking, although this comes with significant uncertainty. There are questions about what happens over Christmas when everyone meets up and its easier for the virus to infect older people who are more at risk. There ar
