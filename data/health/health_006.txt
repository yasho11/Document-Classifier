Wellbeing 2026 Recovery, JOMO and brain boosting supplements4 days agoShareSaveRuth Clegg Health and wellbeing reporter ShareSaveGetty ImagesWellbeing has become such a priceless or in many cases pricey endeavour that we cant seem to get enough of it.Last year, we were mainlining magnesium, consuming creatine - a muscle boosting supplement that became mainstream, and we turned to AI chatbots for help with anything from a personalised training regime to a daily meal plan.And, thats against a backdrop of more than a million people paying privately for weight loss drugs, in some cases completely transforming their relationship with food and exercise.What is the multi-trillion pound industry focussing on in 2026? Several experts give us their thoughts about whats on the wellbeing agenda.RecoveryIf 2025 was about smashing targets at the gym, tracking runs to the second and lifting heavier and heavier weights, then this year is all about recovery.Jak Phillips, a growth director from global fitness brand Les Mills, says its no longer about no pain no gain, something that fitness has built on for years.Technology has made us so much smarter now, he says.
