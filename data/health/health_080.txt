A facelift at 28? Why young people are turning to plastic surgery11 October 2025ShareSaveRuth CleggHealth and wellbeing reporterShareSavehotgirlenhancementsThe facelift is moving into new territory.A quick search on socials and my feed is inundated with posts from people in their late 20s, 30s, discussing different types of facelift - the mini, the ponytail, the deep plane.Gone are the days when facelifts were reserved for the ageing wealthy - now an increasing number of younger people are opting to go under the knife.Some happily share pictures of their face before, after and the very bruised bit in between - their often very painful recovery.Its no longer a procedure thats spoken about in secret, celebrities like Kris Jenner, Catt Sadler and Marc Jacobs have spoken openly about their treatment.
