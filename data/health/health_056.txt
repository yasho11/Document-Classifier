Boris Johnson left the Covid Inquiry in a hurry - hell be pleased not to come back21 October 2025ShareSaveVanessa ClarkeEducation reporterShareSaveClosing schools in Covid a nightmare idea, former PM Boris Johnson saysPapers in hand, Boris Johnson arrived at the Covid Inquiry before the sun came up.He was there to answer questions on decisions he made during the pandemic that directly impacted children.And what an impact they had.School attendance, behaviour, screen time, speech and language - we now know the pandemic had an enduring effect on all of these issues for children.Demand for speech and language support increased markedly after the pandemic.

But the top civil servant at the Department for Education DfE at the time, Jonathan Slater, wrote in his evidence submitted to the inquiry that DfEs contingency plans were premised on the assumption that schools and other education settings would remain open.And Williamson told the inquiry last week that his ability to plan for closures was impeded by Downing Street.It all points to the chaos of the decision-making processes at the heart of government at the time - something explicitly referenced in earlier evidence by the former childrens commissioner Anne Longfield.It wasnt clear who had responsibility for planning for children at the time, she said.What is n
