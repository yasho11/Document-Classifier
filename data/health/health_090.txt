Labours plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma17 March 2025ShareSaveFaisal IslamEconomics editorShareSaveBBCIn the next 24 hours and then over the following fortnight up until the Spring Statement, the government is going to talk a lot about a broken welfare system that is failing the people who use it, the economy and taxpayers.Taking a tough call on fixing it goes against the instincts of much of the Labour Party and has already sparked an internal backlash that could rise to ministerial level, as well as protests.The government is making two key related judgements. The first is that the country cannot afford to sustain recent ballooning increases in the health-related benefit bill and caseload, in particular for mental illness.At the same time, it will argue that a job is the best medicine.Underlying this is an assumption that a health-related benefits system that was built-up to deal with industrial injuries cant apply to the post-pandemic service economy workforce.The net result is likely to be significant changes to Personal Independence Payments, aiming to reduce eligibility for the highest levels of payments, especially among those of working age with mental illness.In addition, there will be a levelling of the generosity of the health component of Universal Credit. This will save billions of pounds, and about a billion of that will be reinvested in trying to help get those capable of part-time work some help for a partial return.Mapping welfare trendsThe Department for Work and Pensions DWP is rolling in real-time data. Cluster analysis maps reveal to ministers exactly who is claiming out of work benefits and where they are.As the numbers continue to increase, the data is being cut by sector, postcode, age and type of illness. Every pattern is being analysed.The idea was that the data would firstly offer the government insight into how it could make billions of pounds of cuts to a rapidly growing bill in order to help the Chancellor meet her self-imposed government borrowing rules.Secondly, it was meant to point to more fundamental reforms to welfare, also designed to temper the same ballooning rise in the costs of dealing with ill health among the working population.The data has thrown up answers.That poor mental health is driving the rise in claimants is clear. To a lesser extent, so too is the role that raising the state pension age has played, with many thousands who would previously have been retired now claiming health-related benefits.But it has also thrown up a major question too does cutting welfare to incentivise people to work more hours in fact do the opposite - nudging them out of the workforce altogether and ultimately increasing the benefit bill?If this is the case - and it is by no means a universally accepted interpretation of what has happened - then the question is whether further cuts could in fact increase the numbers claiming? And should Labour instead invest in getting people back into work?Growing sic
