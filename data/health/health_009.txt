Vitamin pills and icy swims Can you really boost your immune system?9 February 2025ShareSaveJames GallagherInside Health presenter, BBC Radio 4ShareSaveEmma LynchBBCBraving the 3.9C water on a winter morning at the west reservoir in LondonIt is a cold morning in the depths of winter.And I feel like Ive left my sanity as well as my warm clothes in the changing room as I stride out to the edge of a reservoir in my swim shorts.A brightly coloured chalk sign informs me that the water temperature today is a chilly 3.9C, as one of the regulars tells me this is not cold water swimming, its ice water swimming.How did I end up here?Well, Ive become enthralled by the idea of enhancing or boosting the immune system.
