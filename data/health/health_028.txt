Doctors and officials from East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust, which includes Conquest Hospital in Hastings and Eastbourne District General Hospital, also took part in the meeting along with community health representatives. The consultant made a slide presentation entitled Palliative and End of Life Care in Sussex at the meeting, which took place on 4 November.She told the audience that local hospices were struggling and it was difficult to find places for patients who need end-of-life care, while it was sometimes not clear how much support there might be in the local community when people are sent home.She said I am really worried that patients who have treatable conditions are not going to be able to get into hospital and be treated because there are so many end-of-life patients in hospital beds.She went on to say we are no longer putting patients on the waiting list for transfer who are just straightforward dying, focusing only on those with complex needs.On giving enhanced palliative care in AE, the consultant said it was a really difficult choice - do you admit them for corridor care or do you turn them round, put them in the back of the ambulance where they may die on the way home.She argued there were lots of patients in hospital who dont need to be there, lots of patients with complex needs who dont have their needs met.She concluded Weve all known this crisis is coming - it is getting worse and worse.Under significant pressureA spokesperson for the NHS in Sussex said it was committed to ensuring that patients have access to the best possible, high-quality palliative and end-of-life care. They said This includes providing a range of places for compassionate, person-centred care - and importantly, where possible, in settings out of hospital, such as community settings, and our hospices.
